# Introduction
- Wide variety of problems in crypto fall under one bucket
- "Naming system": a system that associates names with cryptographic identities, etc
- Examples: CA, PGP.
- We are proposing a unified system
- Needs to solve problems / have properties: No central points of failure, practicality (i.e.
  human-readability), and cryptographic security
- Zooko's Triangle

# Overview
- Set of servers in different people's hands collectively maintaining set of name registrations
- Clients talk to one or more servers to register names
- Servers run a consensus protocol to agree on new registrations
- Clients look up names, and are guaranteed that other clients see the same results as long as at least one server is correct

# Related work
- Namecoin, yay. Except "bound to use enormous amounts of hashing power to stay secure, and even then there remains the risk of 51% of the power falling into bad hands." 

# Consensus protocol

## Verified mutual broadcast

# Merkle tree

# Fault tolerance
