# Motivation

## Public keys are the best representation of identity

- Identity is well-defined: the public key points to the one who knows the
  corresponding secret key
- One can prove that they know the secret key.
  - if only the prover is online, use signatures
  - if only the verifier is online, use decryption
-

## Public keys are inconvenient to manage

- Public key distribution is hard
- The need to "verify the fingerprint" is not intuitive; lack of usability leads
  to lack of use and thus insecurity
- wide social engineering attack surface

## Name-Identity mapping would help

- The concept of "usernames" is already widespread
- User interfaces would not need to change to allow for better security

# Prior work

## Zooko's Triangle

It has been conjectured that no system will be able to reference people in a way
that is human-meaningful, secure, and without single points of failure.

## Centralized systems

### Certificate Authorities

- A name can be associated with multiple keys, even without the "owner" knowing.
  Certificate Transparency fixes this.
- Failure of *any* CA will result in arbitrary changes. Both issues are already
  being abused by governments.

## Convergence;

- Only for publicly accessible servers, no obvious extension to users
- Downtime would break everything

### DNS TXT records

- No accountability -- can return whatever they want in response to queries
- Centralized; single point of failure. This is already being abused by
  governments.

## Swartz's, Namecoin

 - Requests are ordered by the one who hashes the fastest and verified by all
   clients.

 Problems:

 - Client-side verification is expensive, no defined protocol for thin clients
 - 51% attack
 - No conventional accountability
 - Operating costs and questionable incentive schemes
